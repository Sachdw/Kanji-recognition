"Kuzushiji" or 崩し字 refers to cursive Japanese writing that was used for over a thousand years since the 8th century. However today it is considered illegible to the majority of the Japanese speaking population. It is estimated that today, only approximately 0.01% of native Japanese speakers are able to fluently Kuzushiji. Because of this, a lot of premodern Japanese texts remain inaccessible to the wider public.

The aim of this project is to use the Kuzushiji-Kanji dataset provided by the Center for Open Data in the Humanities (人文学オーペンデーター共同利用センター) to perform exploratory analysis and experiment with building image classifiers to automatically transcribe pre-modern Japanese texts into modern Japanese characters.

The Dataset can be downloaded by visiting this page, and clicking 全体(ZIP 7035.01MB): http://codh.rois.ac.jp/char-shape/book/100241706/

Once you have downloaded the dataset, unzip it and place the folder labelled as 'all' in the same directory as the project.

To open the project, you can do so by typing 'jupyter notebook' in the terminal, and navigating to the file through the Jupyter notebook GUI. You may need to install some extra python packages.

For the models, you can skip the actual model training and load the previously trained models. I have included commenting in the cells indicating if you can skip them.

In the 'presentation' folder you will find a 15 minute video presentation describing the data, methodology, and results of the project.
