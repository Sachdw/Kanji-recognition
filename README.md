-----------------------

"Kuzushiji" or 崩し字 refers to cursive Japanese writing that was used for over a thousand years since the 8th century. However today it is considered illegible to the majority of the Japanese speaking population. It is estimated that today, only approximately 0.01% of native Japanese speakers are able to fluently Kuzushiji. Because of this, a lot of premodern Japanese texts remain inaccessible to the wider public.

The aim of this project is to use the Kuzushiji-Kanji dataset provided by the Center for Open Data in the Humanities (人文学オーペンデーター共同利用センター) to perform exploratory analysis and experiment with building image classifiers to automatically transcribe pre-modern Japanese texts into modern Japanese characters.
